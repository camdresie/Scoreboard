This scoreboard app was created using React. When the app is started, four default players are displayed, each with score '0'. Users are free to add or remove players as they see fit, using the 'x' to the left of each player name or the box at the bottom to add a new player. When a new player is added, their score is set to '0' by default. The '+' and '-' buttons next to each player allow the score for each player to be increased or decreased. When a player has the highest score, the crown icon next to their name is illuminated. At the top left of the app, the stats for the overall game are tracked including the total number of points and the total number of players. There is also a built in stopwatch app that makes use of React's state functionality to run, pause, and reset the timer.
